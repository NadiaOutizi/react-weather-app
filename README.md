Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that leverage modern web technologies to provide users with a native app-like experience directly through their web browser. They are designed to be reliable, fast, and engaging, regardless of the device or network conditions. PWAs offer features such as offline capabilities, push notifications, and the ability to install them on the user's device.

**Service Workers**: Service workers are a key component of PWAs, as they enable offline capabilities and other advanced features. You'll need to implement a service worker in your React app. Libraries like Workbox can help simplify this process by providing pre-built service worker configurations.

**Manifest File**: PWAs require a manifest file (manifest.json) that provides metadata about the application, such as its name, icons, and theme colors. This file enables the PWA to be installed on the user's device and appear as a standalone app.
